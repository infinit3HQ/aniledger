## Test Quality Improvements

### Enhanced Assertions
- Added explicit count assertions for better test clarity
- Included descriptive failure messages for easier debugging
- Verified both positive and negative test cases

### Improved Test Reliability
- Increased wait times to 500ms for async operations to ensure completion
- Added verification of API call counts
- Included initial state verification before applying changes

### Edge Case Coverage
- Empty results handling
- No filter matches
- Multiple filter combinations
- Error scenarios (network, API, decoding, Core Data)

## Mock Objects Used
- **MockAniListAPIClient**: Simulates API responses and errors
- **MockAnimeService**: Simulates library operations

## Test Execution
All tests are designed to run asynchronously using Swift's async/await pattern with proper error handling and timeouts.
