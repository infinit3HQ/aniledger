## Requirements

- macOS 12.0 (Monterey) or later
- Xcode 14.0 or later
- An AniList account (free at [anilist.co](https://anilist.co))

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/infinit3HQ/aniledger.git
cd AniLedger
```

### 2. Configure AniList OAuth

To use AniLedger, you need to register an OAuth application with AniList:

#### Step 1: Create an AniList API Client

1. Go to [AniList Developer Settings](https://anilist.co/settings/developer)
2. Log in with your AniList account
3. Click **"Create New Client"**

#### Step 2: Configure Your API Client

Fill in the following information:

- **Name**: `AniLedger` (or any name you prefer)
- **Redirect URI**: `aniledger://auth-callback`
- **Description**: (optional) "macOS anime tracker application"

Click **"Save"** to create your client.

#### Step 3: Copy Your Credentials

After creating the client, you'll see your **Client ID** and **Client Secret** displayed. 

**Important:** Copy **both** the Client ID and Client Secret. AniList requires the Client Secret for the OAuth token exchange step.

#### Step 4: Configure Your Credentials

Choose one of the following methods to securely configure your credentials:

**Method 1: Automated Setup Script (Recommended)**

Run the setup script and follow the prompts:

```bash
./setup.sh
```

The script will guide you through configuring your credentials in Xcode.

**Method 2: Xcode Environment Variables (Manual)**

1. In Xcode, go to: **Product ‚Üí Scheme ‚Üí Edit Scheme...**
2. Select **"Run"** in the left sidebar
3. Go to the **"Arguments"** tab
4. Under **"Environment Variables"**, click the **"+"** button
5. Add two variables:
   - **Name**: `ANILIST_CLIENT_ID`, **Value**: Your actual Client ID
   - **Name**: `ANILIST_CLIENT_SECRET`, **Value**: Your actual Client Secret
6. Click **"Close"**

**Method 3: .env File**

1. Copy the example file:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
2. Edit `.env` and replace the placeholder values with your actual credentials
3. Source the file before opening Xcode:
   ```bash
   source .env && open AniLedger.xcodeproj
   ```

The `.env` file is gitignored and will not be committed to version control.

### Security Note: About Client Secret

AniList requires both Client ID and Client Secret for OAuth token exchange. While native applications cannot perfectly secure secrets (they can be extracted through reverse engineering), AniList's OAuth implementation requires the Client Secret for the token exchange step. This is a limitation of AniList's OAuth flow, not a design choice.

**Best Practices:**
- Never commit credentials to version control
- Use environment variables for configuration
- Rotate credentials if they are exposed
- The `.env` file and Xcode scheme files are gitignored for your protection

### 3. Build and Run

1. Open `AniLedger.xcodeproj` in Xcode
2. Select your target device (My Mac)
3. Press `Cmd + R` to build and run the application

### 4. First Launch

1. When you first launch AniLedger, you'll see a login screen
2. Click **"Login with AniList"**
3. You'll be redirected to AniList in your default browser
4. Authorize the application
5. You'll be redirected back to AniLedger automatically
6. Your anime lists will sync from AniList

**Quick Start:** For a faster setup process, see [QUICK_START.md](QUICK_START.md)

## Configuration

### App Settings

You can customize AniLedger's behavior in the Settings view:

- **Auto-Sync**: Enable/disable automatic synchronization with AniList (syncs every 15 minutes)
- **Theme**: Choose between Light, Dark, or System theme
- **Account**: View your AniList profile information
- **Data Management**: Re-sync from AniList or clear local data
- **Logout**: Sign out with optional data clearing

### Data Management Features

AniLedger includes robust data management capabilities:

- **Automatic Migration**: Seamless Core Data schema updates with automatic lightweight migration
- **Migration Recovery**: Automatic recovery from corrupted data or failed migrations
- **Re-sync from AniList**: Manually trigger a complete re-sync if data becomes corrupted
- **Clear Local Data**: Remove all cached anime data while keeping your account logged in
- **Clear on Logout**: Optional data clearing when logging out (configurable in Settings)

### Advanced Configuration

Advanced users can modify additional settings in `AniLedger/Config.swift`:

```swift
// Sync Configuration
static let autoSyncInterval: TimeInterval = 15 * 60  // Sync interval in seconds
static let maxSyncRetries = 3                        // Max retry attempts
static let syncRetryDelay: TimeInterval = 5          // Delay between retries

// Cache Configuration
static let imageCacheMemoryLimit = 50 * 1024 * 1024  // 50 MB
static let imageCacheDiskLimit = 200 * 1024 * 1024   // 200 MB
static let imageCacheExpiration: TimeInterval = 7 * 24 * 60 * 60  // 7 days

// UI Configuration
static let discoverPageSize = 50                     // Items per page in Discover
static let searchResultsLimit = 20                   // Search results limit
static let searchDebounceDelay: TimeInterval = 0.5   // Search input debounce
```

## Architecture

AniLedger follows the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture pattern with a clean separation of concerns:

### Layers

- **Models**: Domain models (Anime, UserAnime, AniListUser, etc.)
- **Views**: SwiftUI views for UI presentation
- **ViewModels**: Business logic and state management
- **Services**: API client, authentication, sync, and data services
- **Core Data**: Local persistence layer with automatic migration support
- **GraphQL**: Query and mutation definitions for AniList API

### Key Components

- **AuthenticationService**: OAuth2 flow, token management, and user authentication
- **AniListAPIClient**: GraphQL query/mutation execution with rate limiting
- **SyncService**: Bidirectional data synchronization between local and remote
- **AnimeService**: Local data operations with Core Data
- **KeychainManager**: Secure token storage using macOS Keychain
- **NetworkMonitor**: Real-time network connectivity monitoring
- **ImageCacheManager**: Efficient image loading and caching
- **CoreDataStack**: Core Data setup with automatic migration and recovery

### Design Patterns

- **Protocol-Oriented**: Services use protocols for testability and flexibility
- **Dependency Injection**: ViewModels receive dependencies via initializers
- **Async/Await**: Modern Swift concurrency for asynchronous operations
- **Combine**: Reactive programming for state management
- **Repository Pattern**: AnimeService abstracts data access

## Usage

## Troubleshooting

### Authentication Issues

**Problem**: "Client ID not configured" warning on launch

**Solutions**:
- Verify your environment variables are set correctly
- Check Xcode scheme: Product ‚Üí Scheme ‚Üí Edit Scheme ‚Üí Run ‚Üí Arguments ‚Üí Environment Variables
- Ensure both `ANILIST_CLIENT_ID` and `ANILIST_CLIENT_SECRET` are set
- Try running the setup script: `./setup.sh`

**Problem**: "Authentication failed" error

**Solutions**:
- Verify your Client ID and Client Secret are correct
- Ensure the redirect URI in AniList settings matches exactly: `aniledger://auth-callback`
- Check that your AniList API client is active (not disabled)
- Try logging out and logging in again

### Sync Issues

**Problem**: Changes not syncing with AniList

**Solutions**:
- Check your internet connection (look for offline indicator)
- Verify you're logged in (check Settings ‚Üí Account)
- Try manually syncing by pulling down in Library view
- Check if auto-sync is enabled in Settings
- Try "Re-sync from AniList" in Settings ‚Üí Data Management

**Problem**: Data appears corrupted or out of sync

**Solutions**:
- Go to Settings ‚Üí Data Management
- Click "Re-sync from AniList" to perform a complete re-sync
- This will destroy local data and fetch fresh data from AniList

### Performance Issues

**Problem**: App feels slow or unresponsive

**Solutions**:
- Clear local data: Settings ‚Üí Data Management ‚Üí Clear Local Data
- Check available disk space on your Mac
- Reduce cache limits in `Config.swift` if needed
- Restart the app

**Problem**: Images not loading or loading slowly

**Solutions**:
- Check your internet connection
- Image cache may be full - try clearing local data
- Adjust cache limits in `Config.swift`:
  - `imageCacheMemoryLimit` (default: 50 MB)
  - `imageCacheDiskLimit` (default: 200 MB)

### Data Issues

**Problem**: Core Data migration failed

**Solutions**:
- The app automatically recovers from migration failures
- If issues persist, use "Re-sync from AniList" in Settings
- Check Console.app for detailed error logs
